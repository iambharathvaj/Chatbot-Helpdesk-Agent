## Implementing a Helpdesk Chatbot with Dialogflow &amp; BigQuery ML - Web hosted

I have trained a simple machine learning model (Linear Regression) for predicting helpdesk response time using BigQuery Machine Learning. Then I built a simple chatbot using Dialogflow and integrated the trained BigQuery ML model with the helpdesk chatbot. The final solution will provide an estimate of response time to users at the moment a request is generated!

## Test my Chatbot (Bharath's-Bot)
### Web Demo: https://bot.dialogflow.com/bharath-bot-1 

My bot will help you to automatically submit a ticket by describing your issue (Here the bot acts as an assistant for the IT Department). Then the bot will create a ticket for the user and informs the user with the resolution/response time (by the tech support).

## Test my bot! (You can also use voice support for input)
Use the following conversation to submit a ticket. (Replace the content in double quotes with appropriate contents.

  1. Hi/Hello
  2. I would like to submit a ticket
  3. My email is "Your email id"
  4. "Your issue"
  
Example issues:

  1. I have a problem with my laptop
  2. My printer isn't working
  3. I need a software license
  4. I can't login
  5. My computer is slow
